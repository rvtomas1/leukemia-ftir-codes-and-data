# leukemia-ftir-codes-and-data
This repository showcases a database of 10,000 generated IR spectrum samples of leukemia cases (N=5000) and healthy controls (N=5000). Only the fingerprint region (1800 cm^-1 to 850 cm^-1 at 4 cm^-1 resolution) was considered.

1. Start obtaining a dataset using "getData.m"
2. Generate new data using "generatePseudodata.m"

Note that the original dataset can not be given due to patenting issues.
